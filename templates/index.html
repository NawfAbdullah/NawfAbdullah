		<p class="channel-Description" >Hey, I am Nawf  Abdullah, a python programmer and founder of Code with Nawf. I used to write a lot of code at my home. I am passionate about coding because I love what I do. This passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to show my best. I am a self-taught Python programmer. I love coding because it makes me think out of the box and use my brain. Now I've started learning about HTML and CSS and started moving to my next goal.</p>
